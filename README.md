In these trying times, students all around the world are learning virtually through video calls and online websites due to the pandemic. They are required to sit in front of a computer, watching a lecture for 6 hours, shattering the interactive nature of in-person education. As a result, learning becomes very boring for many students, causing them to drift off and lose focus as well as not being effective for teaching. In other words the education of 2.2 billion children in virtually every single country in the world has been and still is being impacted negatively by the pandemic. By leveraging VR technology, we allow physics students to experience their labs first-hand in a 3D environment as if they were in their classroom.
